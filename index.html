    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I was raised on a farm in North Dakota. At an early age, I knew
        that farming would not be my career choice. At the age of 16 when
        my peers were buying their first cars, I earned the money to buy
        an Apple //e computer. It fascinated me so much I learned everything I
        possibly could, including how the circuitry worked.
    </p>

    <p>
        I took a longer route than usual to complete my college credentials
        because I worked while making my way through the educational process.
        I made my family proud by being the first person in the extended
        Gustavson family to earn a bachelor's degree.
    </p>

    <p>
        My professional career since 1992 has taken me from a focus on
        hardware and C programming to software quality assurance, and in
        recent years, to web development which is my favorite area of
        technology!

        Javascript and Ruby.  In 2007, I began developing web applications
        full time. I love it!
